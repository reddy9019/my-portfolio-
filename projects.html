   <h2>💼 Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
   <p>As part of my internship at CodTech IT Solutions, I developed a fully responsive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and background. This project helped me understand front-end development principles, user interface design, and deploying live websites. The portfolio includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact, all designed with a clean and professional layout.</p>
   <h3>🔍 Key Features:</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Clean, professional layout with smooth navigation.</li>
    <li>Responsive design for all screen sizes.</li>
    <li>Downloadable resume and project showcase sections.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>🏨 Hotel Feedback Page</h2>
   <p>Also during my internship, I designed and built a Hotel Feedback Page where users can submit their reviews and ratings based on their stay. This project focused on user interaction, form handling, and clean UI presentation.</p>
    <h3>🔍 Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>User-friendly form for submitting feedback.</li>
        <li>Real-time validation and submission confirmation.</li>
        <li>Responsive design for mobile and desktop views.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>🔐 Voice Authentication System</h2>
    <p> I developed a Voice-Based Authentication System that verifies user identity based on their unique voice patterns and wavelength features. The system processes audio input, extracts specific characteristics such as pitch, frequency, and wavelength, and compares them for identity verification. This project introduced me to the fundamentals of biometric security and audio signal analysis.</p>
    <h3>🔍 Key Features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Captures voice samples and analyzes their wavelength and pitch.</li>
        <li>Uses signal processing techniques to compare and verify users.</li>
        <li>Demonstrates the application of audio biometrics for secure authentication.</li>

</ul>
